            The Zabbix key unbound.num.answer.rcode.NOTIMPL is used to monitor the number of DNS responses returned by the Unbound server with a response code of NOTIMPL during a certain period of time.
            
            NOTIMPL is a DNS response code that indicates that the server does not support the requested type of DNS query. By monitoring this key, system administrators can detect potential issues with the Unbound server's configuration or capabilities in handling certain types of DNS queries.

            REFUSED is a DNS response code that indicates that the server refuses to process the DNS query. By monitoring this key, system administrators can detect potential issues with the Unbound server's configuration or security settings, such as firewall rules or access controls, that are blocking or denying DNS queries.

          description: |
            The Zabbix key unbound.num.rrset.bogus is used to monitor the number of Resource Record Sets (RRsets) that fail DNSSEC validation and are deemed "bogus" by the Unbound server during a certain period of time.
            
            DNSSEC provides a mechanism to validate the authenticity and integrity of DNS data. If a DNS response fails validation, Unbound will mark the corresponding RRset as "bogus" and discard it. By monitoring this key, system administrators can measure the number of RRsets that are being discarded due to DNSSEC validation failures.
            
            This information can be used to identify and resolve issues with DNSSEC validation, such as misconfigured DNSSEC zones or missing DNSSEC trust anchors. By ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the DNS data, monitoring this key can help to prevent DNS cache poisoning attacks and other DNS-related security issues.
