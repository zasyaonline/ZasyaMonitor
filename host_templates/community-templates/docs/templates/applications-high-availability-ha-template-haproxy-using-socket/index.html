<h1 id="haproxy">HAProxy</h1>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>How to install:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add in HAProxy (or make sure that you have) next rules to enable statistics on socket</li>
</ol>

<p>vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg<br />
stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats mode 666 level admin<br />
stats timeout 30s</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Install socat and nc: yum install nc socat -yum</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Make sure that HAProxy user can read from socket :sudo -uhaproxy echo “show info;show stat”</td>
          <td>socat stdio unix-connect:/var/lib/haproxy/stats</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Copy files:</li>
</ol>

<p>a) <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userparameter\_haproxy.conf</code> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/zabbix/zabbix\_agentd.d/</code></p>

<p>b) haproxy_discovery.sh in /etc/zabbix/scripts/</p>

<p>c) haproxy_stats.sh in /etc/zabbix/scripts/</p>

<p>Make b and c scripts executable with chmod +x script_name</p>

<p>Note: Make sure that /etc/zabbix/scripts/ exist, if not, create it: mkdir -p /etc/zabbix/scripts/</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add host for HAProxy in Zabbix, add template, wait some time for get data</li>
</ol>

<p>(You can change LLD discovery time to get data more faster, but after change to initial)</p>

<p>This template is based on:</p>

<p>a) Solution by Anastas Dancha  - https://github.com/anapsix/zabbix-haproxy</p>

<p>b) Official template from Zabbix for Zabbix &gt; 4.4 - https://www.zabbix.com/integrations/haproxy</p>

<p>The reason why I create this template was to have official zabbix template logic in Zabbix under 4.4</p>

<p>Files are there</p>

<p>b) https://drive.google.com/open?id=16xoJyWut9R_EudcRyAf2Ui8WuPyTxw6D</p>

      <td>&lt;p&gt;Current number of requests on backend unassigned in queue is more than 10. If your backend is bombarded with connections to the point you have reached your global maxconn limit, HAProxy will seamlessly queue new connections in system kernel’s socket queue until a backend server becomes available. Keeping connections out of the queue is ideal, resulting in less latency and a better user experience. You should alert if the size of your queue exceeds the threshold. If you find that connections are consistently enqueueing, configuration changes may be in order, such as increasing global maxconn limit or changing the connection limits on individual backend servers. Keep in mind: empty queue = happy client&lt;/p&gt;</td>

      <td>&lt;p&gt;Number of requests on backend, whose responses yielded an error, is more than 10. The backend error response rate represents the number of response errors generated by your backends. This includes errors caused by data transfers aborted by the servers as well as write errors on the client socket and failures due to ACLs. Combined with other error metrics, the backend error response rate helps diagnose the root cause of response errors. For example, an increase in both the backend error response rate and denied responses could indicate that clients are repeatedly attempting to access ACL-ed resources.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

Client-side request errors could have a number of causes: client terminates before sending request read error from client client timeout client terminated connection request was tarpitted/subject to ACL Under normal conditions, it is acceptable to (infrequently) receive invalid requests from clients. However, a significant increase in the number of invalid requests received could be a sign of larger, looming issues. For example, an abnormal number of terminations or timeouts by numerous clients could mean that your application is experiencing excessive latency, causing clients to manually close their connections.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

      <td>&lt;p&gt;For every HAProxy session, two connections are consumed—one for the client to HAProxy, and the other for HAProxy to your backend. Alerting on this metric is essential to ensure your server has sufficient capacity to handle all concurrent sessions. Unlike requests, upon reaching the session limit HAProxy will deny additional clients until resource consumption drops. Furthermore, if you find your session usage percentage to be hovering above 80%, it could be time to either modify HAProxy’s configuration to allow more sessions, or migrate your HAProxy server to a bigger box.&lt;/p&gt;</td>
