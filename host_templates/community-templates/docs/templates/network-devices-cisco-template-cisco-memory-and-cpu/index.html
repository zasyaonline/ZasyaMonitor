<p>Template for all Cisco devices which support the CISCO-MEMORY-POOL-MIB and CISCO-PROCESS-MIB.</p>

<p>Discovery all CPUs and memory pools with dynamic trigger thresholds (macro context) and flapping prevention (use of .max()/.min() functions).</p>

<p>You need to create a user macro on the template or global level with name {$CRD_SNMPV2_R} = “yourSNMPv2ReadCommunity”.</p>
