When available bytes are plentiful, the Virtual Memory Manager lets the working sets of processes grow, or keeps them stable by removing an old page for each new page added. When available bytes are few, the Virtual Memory Manager must trim the working sets of processes to maintain the minimum required. Threshold: Low on available memory – less than 10% available.

Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays. It is the sum of Memory Pages Input/sec and Memory Pages Output/sec. It is counted in numbers of pages, so it can be compared to other counts of pages, such as Memory Page Faults/sec, without conversion. It includes pages retrieved to satisfy faults in the file system cache (usually requested by applications) non-cached mapped memory files. Threshold: High pages/sec – greater than 1000 (If it’s higher than 1000, the system is could be beginning to run out of memory. Consider reviewing the processes to see which processes are taking up the most memory or consider adding more memory). Very high average pages/sec – greater than 2500 (If this is greater than 2500, the system could be experiencing system-wide delays due to insufficient memory. Consider reviewing the processes to see which processes are taking up the most memory or consider adding more memory). Critically high average pages/sec – greater than 5000 (If this is greater than 5000. If so, the system is most likely experiencing delays due to insufficient memory.

      <td>Processor Queue Length</td>
      <td>&lt;p&gt;If there are more tasks ready to run than there are processors, threads queue up. The processor queue is the collection of threads that are ready but not able to be executed by the processor because another active thread is currently executing. A sustained or recurring queue of more than two threads is a clear indication of a processor bottleneck. You may get more throughput by reducing parallelism in those cases. You can use this counter in conjunction with the Processor % Processor Time counter to determine if your application can benefit from more CPUs. There is a single queue for processor time, even on multiprocessor computers. Therefore, in a multiprocessor computer, divide the Processor Queue Length (PQL) value by the number of processors servicing the workload. If the CPU is very busy (90 percent and higher utilization) and the PQL average is consistently higher than 2 per processor, you may have a processor bottleneck that could benefit from additional CPUs. Or, you could reduce the number of threads and queue more at the application level. This will cause less context switching, and less context switching is good for reducing CPU load. The common reason for a PQL of 2 or higher with low CPU utilization is that requests for processor time arrive randomly and threads demand irregular amounts of time from the processor. This means that the processor is not a bottleneck but that it is your threading logic that needs to be improved. Threshold: Average - each processor has 10 or more threads waiting.(Determines if the average processor queue length exceeds the number of processors by 10. If this threshold is broken, then the processor(s) may be at capacity). High - each processor has 20 or more threads waiting(Determines if the average processor queue length exceeds twenty times the number of processors. If this threshold is broken, then the processor(s) are beyond capacity).&lt;/p&gt;</td>

Symptoms. Third-party monitoring tool may generate multiple alarm events during times when your disk is very busy. If you monitor the Physical %Disk Time on your Windows based computer, you may note that the value may go over 100% if your computer is very busy. For example, this could occur if you are copying a large amount of files, or you are copying multiple large files, and so on. Cause. This behavior can occur because some controllers allow the operating system to use overlapping input/output operations for multiple outstanding requests. The disk performance counters time the responses by using a 100 nanosecond precision counter, and then report the cumulative statistics for a given sample time. This sample time could go over 100% if, for example, you have 10 requests that completed in 2 milliseconds each in a 10 millisecond sampling interval. If you have multiple disks in a Raid arrangement, the overlapped input/output happens because the operating system can read and write to multiple disks, and this could show values that are higher than 100% for this counter.

When available bytes are plentiful, the Virtual Memory Manager lets the working sets of processes grow, or keeps them stable by removing an old page for each new page added. When available bytes are few, the Virtual Memory Manager must trim the working sets of processes to maintain the minimum required. Threshold: Low on available memory – less than 10% available.

      <td>Processor Queue Length</td>
      <td>&lt;p&gt;If there are more tasks ready to run than there are processors, threads queue up. The processor queue is the collection of threads that are ready but not able to be executed by the processor because another active thread is currently executing. A sustained or recurring queue of more than two threads is a clear indication of a processor bottleneck. You may get more throughput by reducing parallelism in those cases. You can use this counter in conjunction with the Processor % Processor Time counter to determine if your application can benefit from more CPUs. There is a single queue for processor time, even on multiprocessor computers. Therefore, in a multiprocessor computer, divide the Processor Queue Length (PQL) value by the number of processors servicing the workload. If the CPU is very busy (90 percent and higher utilization) and the PQL average is consistently higher than 2 per processor, you may have a processor bottleneck that could benefit from additional CPUs. Or, you could reduce the number of threads and queue more at the application level. This will cause less context switching, and less context switching is good for reducing CPU load. The common reason for a PQL of 2 or higher with low CPU utilization is that requests for processor time arrive randomly and threads demand irregular amounts of time from the processor. This means that the processor is not a bottleneck but that it is your threading logic that needs to be improved. Threshold: Average - each processor has 10 or more threads waiting.(Determines if the average processor queue length exceeds the number of processors by 10. If this threshold is broken, then the processor(s) may be at capacity). High - each processor has 20 or more threads waiting(Determines if the average processor queue length exceeds twenty times the number of processors.

Symptoms. Third-party monitoring tool may generate multiple alarm events during times when your disk is very busy. If you monitor the Physical %Disk Time on your Windows based computer, you may note that the value may go over 100% if your computer is very busy. For example, this could occur if you are copying a large amount of files, or you are copying multiple large files, and so on. Cause. This behavior can occur because some controllers allow the operating system to use overlapping input/output operations for multiple outstanding requests. The disk performance counters time the responses by using a 100 nanosecond precision counter, and then report the cumulative statistics for a given sample time. This sample time could go over 100% if, for example, you have 10 requests that completed in 2 milliseconds each in a 10 millisecond sampling interval. If you have multiple disks in a Raid arrangement, the overlapped input/output happens because the operating system can read and write to multiple disks, and this could show values that are higher than 100% for this counter. Status. This behavior is by design.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

The Virtual Memory Manager continually adjusts the space used in physical memory and on disk to maintain a minimum number of available bytes for the operating system and processes. When available bytes are plentiful, the Virtual Memory Manager lets the working sets of processes grow, or keeps them stable by removing an old page for each new page added. When available bytes are few, the Virtual Memory Manager must trim the working sets of processes to maintain the minimum required. Threshold: Low on available memory – less than 10% available. Very low on available memory – less than 5% available. Decreasing trend of 10 MB’s per hour. This could indicate a memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;</td>

When a page is faulted, the system tries to read multiple contiguous pages into memory to maximize the benefit of the read operation. Compare the value of Memory Pages Input/sec to the value of Memory Page Reads/sec to determine the average number of pages read into memory during each read operation.

      <td>&lt;p&gt;If it is high, then the system is likely running out of memory by trying to page the memory to the disk. Pages/sec is the rate at which pages are read from or written to disk to resolve hard page faults. This counter is a primary indicator of the kinds of faults that cause system-wide delays.

      <td>&lt;p&gt;If there are more tasks ready to run than there are processors, threads queue up. The processor queue is the collection of threads that are ready but not able to be executed by the processor because another active thread is currently executing. A sustained or recurring queue of more than two threads is a clear indication of a processor bottleneck. You may get more throughput by reducing parallelism in those cases. You can use this counter in conjunction with the Processor % Processor Time counter to determine if your application can benefit from more CPUs. There is a single queue for processor time, even on multiprocessor computers. Therefore, in a multiprocessor computer, divide the Processor Queue Length (PQL) value by the number of processors servicing the workload. If the CPU is very busy (90 percent and higher utilization) and the PQL average is consistently higher than 2 per processor, you may have a processor bottleneck that could benefit from additional CPUs. Or, you could reduce the number of threads and queue more at the application level. This will cause less context switching, and less context switching is good for reducing CPU load. The common reason for a PQL of 2 or higher with low CPU utilization is that requests for processor time arrive randomly and threads demand irregular amounts of time from the processor. This means that the processor is not a bottleneck but that it is your threading logic that needs to be improved. Threshold: Average - each processor has 10 or more threads waiting.(Determines if the average processor queue length exceeds the number of processors by 10. If this threshold is broken, then the processor(s) may be at capacity). High - each processor has 20 or more threads waiting(Determines if the average processor queue length exceeds twenty times the number of processors.

If you monitor the Physical %Disk Time on your Windows based computer, you may note that the value may go over 100% if your computer is very busy. For example, this could occur if you are copying a large amount of files, or you are copying multiple large files, and so on. Cause. This behavior can occur because some controllers allow the operating system to use overlapping input/output operations for multiple outstanding requests. The disk performance counters time the responses by using a 100 nanosecond precision counter, and then report the cumulative statistics for a given sample time. This sample time could go over 100% if, for example, you have 10 requests that completed in 2 milliseconds each in a 10 millisecond sampling interval. If you have multiple disks in a Raid arrangement, the overlapped input/output happens because the operating system can read and write to multiple disks, and this could show values that are higher than 100% for this counter.
